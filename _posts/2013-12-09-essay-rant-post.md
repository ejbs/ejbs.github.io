In highschool and in University we are often assigned tasks to write "an essay about <subject X> in 1000 words or more" and I think that this is probably not the best way to
let your students become better writers. There are several reasons for why I think this is and I've tried to state and motivate these reasons below.

**If you need to say something then you will want to put effort into saying it in the best way you can.**

This means that you will go back and revise what you've written several times over.
You will be changing the structure of the essay and more importantly you will rewrite what you've said to more efficiently communicate what you're trying to say.
One of the reasons that you'll be able to do this is because writing down what you're thinking is a good way of forcing you to put down an abstract idea into a formal representation of that idea.
Writing down your idea often makes your perception of the idea improve as you realise problems with the idea and subtle corner cases you didn't think of before and your
following iterations of your essay will reflect upon that.
As you get a stronger grasp on the idea you will be able to more efficiently communicate your thoughts about the idea which will lead to a shorter essay and realising the
corner cases and problems of the idea will help lengthening the essay.
A good essay will therefore regulate the length of itself without anyone needing to put a restriction on the length of the essay.
This may not be enough but with time for this kind of reflection you will also learn how to restrict yourself in scope.

If a teacher says that you need to hand in an essay about file sharing and its effects written in a 1000 words on Friday then I'd assume that the subject and word count
requirement has been picked appropriately and therefore the length prescribed can be achieved with moderate difficulty as long as you write a good[0] essay.
There is simply no way that you can inform your reader about file sharing and also talk about your own opinions on the matter in 200 words or less and at the same time
have written a good essay.
But not everyone can write a good essay, at least not in highschool but we sure want to teach them how. Which leads me to my next point.


**This kind of essays also leads to encouraging bad writers to stay bad.**

In a situation where you are pushed to write a certain amount of words you are directly discouraged to reflect over what you've written, because this means that
you will waste time on not increasing that precious word count and in the worst case you will have to decrease the word count because you've found a way to express yourself
better than before.
So a student who is a bad writer won't get the chance to improve, especially as he probably needs a lot more time to fulfill the word requirement that the teacher has put out.
Instead he will focus on being just mediocre enough to pass.
We do not want reflection to be a high risk activity.
We should not teach students how to write solely for the reason of making them able to push out a mediocre essay about Abraham Lincoln.
We should instead teach students how to write so that they can better reason about what they are thinking and feeling.
This is the true win of writing, to be able to dissect what you're saying and see how you can improve yourself through this dissection.

If you do want your students to produce something worthy of reading then simply give them a subject and say "Write something good."
I'm sure it won't suck nearly as bad as you think it's going to.
